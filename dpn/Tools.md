# Tools

Deepen intends to use as much as possible commonly available tools:

## Mindmap

* Brainstorm sessions to collect and restructure content
* Export to `.md` files and folders
* Import from files/folders

## File manager

* Browser a file/folder structure
* Reworking a file/folder structure
  * Rename files, move files, remove files, create folders
  * This requires that all Metadata is local to a file and links are based on stable artefacts
* Preview file content
  * [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
* Open files with editor
* Display Metadata
  * Ranger's `line command` can be used

## Editor

* View and rework content
* File/folder browsing support
* Searching for files on name
* Searching for content
* Collapse
* Open file when hoovering over filename

## Version management

* Track changes applied to file content
* Indicate new files
